### Aggregative Coarsening for Multilevel Hypergraph Partitioning
##### Accepted: [SEA18](http://cs.gssi.it/sea2018/accepted.php)

Algorithms for many hypergraph problems, including partitioning, utilize multilevel frameworks to achieve a good trade-off between the performance and the quality of results. In this paper we introduce two novel aggregative coarsening schemes and incorporate them within state-of-the-art hypergraph partitioner Zoltan. Our coarsening schemes are inspired by the algebraic multigrid and stable matching approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed schemes as a part of multilevel hypergraph partitioning framework on a wide range of problems.

### Relaxation-Based Coarsening for Multilevel Hypergraph Partitioning
##### Submitted: Fall 2017

Multilevel hypergraph partitioning, as well as many other algorithms on hypergraphs, relies on a measure of similarity between vertices to make decisions. In hypergraph partitioning setting, the decision is which vertices to merge at the coarsening stage of the algorithm. In this paper we introduce a new vertex similarity measure, as well as a coarsening scheme using it. The effectiveness is demonstrated by comparing the performance with other state-of-the-art hypergraph partitioners on problems from the [Hypergraph Partitioning Archive](http://shaydul.in/hypergraph-partitioning-archive/)

### Warping TensorFaces: Preprocessing Images for Multilinear Analysis of Facial Image Ensembles
##### Spring 2018

An exploratory study of using preprocessing to improve the quality of multilinear analysis of facial images for facial recognition. Multilinear analysis is motivated by the fact that images are results of multiple factors like light conditions, pose and expression. However, we are not able to observe these latent variables. Multilinear analysis takes advantage of tensor decomposition methods to utilize those hidden variables. In this project we use Active Appearance models to warp the training images before using them to train the model. This project is based on the paper [Multilinear image analysis for facial recognition by Vasilescu et al.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1048350/)
