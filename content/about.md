### Who am I?
I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at Clemson University. I work under the supervision of [Ilya Safro](https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~isafro/) in the [Algorithms and Computational Science Lab](https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~isafro/group.html). 

Before that, I've received a Bachelors degree in Applied Mathematics and Physics from [Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology](https://mipt.ru/english/). 

Here's my [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/njayar01aww562f/Resume%20Tech%20Master.pdf).

### What do I do?
My research focusses around hypergraph algorithms, multiscale methods, combinatorial optimization and large-scale computing.
